QUESTIONS:

1. Do countries with higher Cybersecurity Index have lower amount of attacks? 
2. Which countries with higher index management have lesser resolution time after the attack? 
3. Which kind of method is more related to the volume of compromised data? 
4. Which method of attack targets industries the most? 
5. What is the average time for a resolution after an attack (filter by an attack method)? 
6. What is the mitigation strategy and time to mitigate. Strategy might be related to the method. 
7. How financial loss is related to the amount/type of the lost data? 


(Task for ≈Åukasz): Find correlation (if it exists based on the data) between indexes like NCSI, CEI, GCI, DDL etc. Introduce MAX and MIN sorting per year, overtime, losess - sort by country, each year, then the maximum attacks/complaint (amount). We can compare for: money lost divided by the number of complaints.
