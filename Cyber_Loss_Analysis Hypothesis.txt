Executive message (30-sec version)

Cyber losses are rising faster than reports. 
From 2019→2024, global losses climbed from ~$27.7B to ~$118.6B while complaints (confirmed reported cyber attacks) rose from ~2.9M to 5.9M. 
Loss-per-complaint nearly doubled ($9.6k → ~$20.0k). 
Risk is highly concentrated (top 10 countries ≈ 59% of 2024 loss), and country rankings are very stable year-to-year (ρ≈0.99). 
This suggests we can get outsized impact by focusing on a small set of countries and the highest-severity incident types.

Hypotheses, why they matter, and how you’ll test them



H1 — Severity is increasing (not just volume).

Story: Complaints are up, but loss-per-complaint is rising even faster. 
That means each incident is getting more expensive
(bigger ransoms, deeper supply-chain impact, higher business interruption).

Evidence now: Loss-per-complaint grew from ~$9.6k (2019) → ~$20.0k (2024).

Test: In your notebook, compute yearly loss_per_complaint = total_losses / total_complaints and plot a line; 
run a Spearman correlation between year and loss_per_complaint (>0 supports H1).

If true, action: Prioritize severity reducers 
(backup/restore drills, MFA coverage gaps, EDR rollouts) over pure awareness volume.



H2 — Risk is concentrated in a few markets.

Story: A small country set drives most of the money at risk.

Evidence now: 2024: Top 5 ≈ 41%, Top 10 ≈ 59%, Top 20 ≈ 78% of losses.

Test: Rank countries by 2024 losses; compute cumulative share (you already did this).

If true, action: Focus budget, tabletop exercises, and incident-response SLAs on the top 10 countries first; 
set country-specific targets.



H3 — Country risk is persistent (structural), not random.

Story: The countries that were high-loss in 2023 are still high-loss in 2024, implying structural drivers
(digitalization level, exposure, reporting culture).

Evidence now: Spearman ρ≈0.994 between 2023 and 2024 losses by country.

Test: Year-to-year rank correlations; optionally extend to 2019→2024.

If true, action: Make multi-year country playbooks (not one-offs), 
align vendor controls, regulatory engagement, and red-team focus to those markets.



H4 — Complaint volume is a strong (and possibly leading) indicator of loss.

Story: Places with more complaints also lose more; spikes in complaints may predict next-period losses.

Evidence now (same-year): 2024 Pearson≈0.925, Spearman≈0.965 between complaints and losses across countries.

Test:

Same-year scatter & correlation (already done).

Lag test: by country, regress losses_year_t on complaints_year_(t-1) (quick OLS or correlation).

If true, action: Build a weekly “early warning” KPI: if complaints jump X% in top markets,
pre-position response teams and push controls (e.g., tighten email filtering).



H5 — Outliers signal under-reporting or high-impact attacks.

Story: Some countries have unusually high loss-per-complaint (few reports but huge cost)
or low loss-per-complaint (many small incidents or better mitigation).

Test: Compute loss_per_complaint by country for 2024; look at top/bottom deciles. 
Validate outliers using teammate’s threats file to see if ransomware or BEC dominates.

If true, action:

High LPC → hunt for under-reporting or major-incident clusters; add forensics/IR readiness.

Low LPC → cross-learn mitigations to replicate in other markets.



H6 — Loss growth outpaces complaint growth (attack quality improved).

Story: From 2021 onward, losses accelerate faster than complaint counts—attackers 
are getting more efficient (automation, better social engineering, supply-chain leverage).

Evidence now: 2021→2024 shows steep loss slope vs. flatter complaint slope.

Test: Compare CAGR of total losses vs total complaints (2019–2024); plot the two lines (you already do).

If true, action: Shift roadmap toward impact-reduction
(segmentation, least privilege, backup immutability, privileged access management)
rather than just incident count suppression.



H7 — (Integration with teammates) Lower cyber-readiness scores → higher losses.

Story: Countries with weaker readiness (e.g., lower NCSI/GCI) should have higher losses.

Test (merge with Cyber_security.csv): Map by country; run Spearman between loss levels and indices 
(expect negative correlation if higher index = better security). 
If you see gaps, try transforming to loss per GDP or loss per internet user (structural size matters).

If true, action: Direct capability-building (MFA coverage, phishing simulation, patch cadence) in low-index countries first.



H8 — (Integration with threats) A few attack types drive most of the money.

Story: If ransomware/BEC/phishing dominate in your threats file, they likely explain much of the loss pattern.

Test: From Global_Cybersecurity_Threats_2015-2024.csv: group by attack_type and year; compare 
counts/severity to your country losses (same-year and lag).

If true, action: Targeted controls (e.g., DMARC/MTA-STS for BEC, hardening RDP/VPN for ransomware initial access, rapid patching for top CVEs).




“Slide-ready” storyline (talk track)


1. What we asked:
Are losses going up just because we see more incidents, or are incidents getting worse? 
Where should we act first?


2. What the data says:

Losses +18% YoY (2024 vs 2023).

Loss-per-complaint nearly 2× since 2019.

Risk is concentrated (top 10 countries ≈ 59% of 2024 loss).

Country ranks are sticky (ρ≈0.99), and complaints strongly track losses (r≈0.93–0.97).


3. What that means: 
We can get the biggest impact by focusing on the top 10 countries and the top attack types,
and by investing in severity-reducing controls.


4. What we’ll do next (60–90 days):

Stand up a “Loss Watch” dashboard: (losses, complaints, loss-per-complaint) by country, weekly.

Early-warning rule: 
if complaints jump ≥X% in a top-10 country → trigger playbook (email hardening, MFA push, awareness nudge, IR readiness).

Country playbooks:
for the top 10: close MFA gaps, test backups/restore, EDR coverage, privilege audits.

Attack-type sprints (from threats data):
e.g., anti-BEC (DMARC/brand protection) and ransomware (RDP/VPN hardening).

Define a target: reduce loss-per-complaint by 10–15% in top-10 countries within 2 quarters.


Notes & caveats to say out loud

The dataset is aggregated by country/year; it doesn’t prove causation.

2024 may still be incomplete in some sources; treat absolute figures directionally.

Currency harmonization and economic size (GDP, internet population) matter; for deeper fairness, normalize by those.
